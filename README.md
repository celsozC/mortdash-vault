  "fromDate": "2024-01-01",
  "toDate": "2024-01-31"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "meetings": [

      "recordings": [
        {
          "id": "recording_id",
          "file_type": "MP4",
          "file_size": 1048576,
          "download_url": "https://...",
          "status": "completed"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Technical Details

### Zoom API Integration

The application uses the Zoom API v2 with OAuth authentication:

- **Authentication**: OAuth tokens generated from Client ID and Secret
- **Endpoint**: `/users/{userId}/recordings`
- **Rate Limits**: Respects Zoom API rate limits
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API failures

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID` | Your Zoom Account ID | Yes |
| `ZOOM_KEY` | Your Zoom Client ID | Yes |
| `ZOOM_SECRET` | Your Zoom Client Secret | Yes |
| `ZOOM_GRANT_TYPE` | OAuth grant type (default: account_credentials) | No |
| `ZOOM_API_URL` | Zoom API base URL | No |
| `ZOOM_AUTH_URL` | Zoom OAuth token URL | No |

### Frontend Features

- **Form Validation**: React Hook Form for robust form handling
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS for mobile-first design
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for better development experience

## Security Considerations

- API credentials are stored securely in environment variables
- No credentials are exposed in the frontend
- All API calls are made server-side to protect credentials
- HTTPS is required for production deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Missing environment variables"**
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set in `.env.local`
   - Restart the development server after adding environment variables

2. **"Invalid Zoom credentials"**
   - Verify your Account ID, Client ID, and Client Secret are correct
   - Ensure your Zoom App is properly configured with Server-to-Server OAuth

3. **"No recordings found"**
   - Check that the user has recordings in the specified date range
   - Verify the user ID is correct (use email address)

4. **"Rate limit exceeded"**
   - Wait a few minutes before making another request
   - Consider reducing the date range
